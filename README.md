AI‑Powered Code Reviewer (MERN + Local LLM)
---
Haufe Group Hackathon 2025 - Balan Razvan

An **AI‑powered code review assistant** built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and integrated with **Ollama** for local Large Language Model (LLM) inference.  
This project combines **traditional linters** (Ruff for Python, ESLint for JavaScript) with **AI reasoning** to deliver fast, private, and intelligent code reviews.

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Full Review**: Analyze the entire repository for issues, style problems, and security risks.  
- ⚡ **Staged Review**: Review only the changes you’ve staged with `git add` — perfect for pre‑commit checks.  
- 🛡️ **Privacy‑first**: The LLM runs locally via Ollama, so **no code ever leaves your environment**.  
- 🧠 **Hybrid analysis**: Combines static analysis (linters) with AI insights for deeper feedback.  
- 📊 **Persistent storage**: Review runs and results are stored in MongoDB for history and reporting.  
- 🌐 **Modern stack**: MERN architecture with TypeScript on the backend and Vite + React on the frontend.
